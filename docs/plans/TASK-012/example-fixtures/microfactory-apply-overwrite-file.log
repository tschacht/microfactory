# Fixture: microfactory-apply-overwrite-file.log
# Source: session-52f1d07d-5d2a-40a7-9810-e5898779f287
# Purpose: Shows the Microfactory-side lifecycle around applying an XML-based
# solution: a solution vote completes, an XML `<file>` block is written to
# `src/main.rs` via the `overwrite_file` applier, `cargo check` runs as the
# verifier, and the step is marked completed.
